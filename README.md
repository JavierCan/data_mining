## Mobility for everyone
Student mobility has become a critical aspect in the planning and operation of university college campus. This project arises as an innovative response to the need to improve the efficiency and sustainability of student transportation. Initially, a K-means clustering algorithm, whose implementation is documented and accessible in this repository, has been applied to discern significant patterns in student mobility, facilitating the identification of clusters of users with similar routes and schedules.

With this analytical foundation, the project is preparing to move into a new stage of technological development. It is intended to explore and analyze the applicability and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms, with a particular focus on Q-learning techniques. It is planned that this future implementation will strengthen the system's ability to dynamically adapt to the fluctuations and changing demands of the campus mobility environment, ensuring an optimal and progressively smarter carpool matching method.
